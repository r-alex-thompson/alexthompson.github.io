This is my website. I'll fill it with some info soon and try to keep it updated. 
I need a page with a bio, CV, photo. 
Then, I need another page with research projects.
Then, another page with publications.
Create a page w/ code from papers, packages, other stuff I make (3D printed objects, for instance, dendrometer if I get there)
Contact page. 
Should I have a "communication" page? Need to do more of this stuff.
